	<brief_description>
		A fast verlet rope class.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The class renders "rope" using verlet integration. It supports using nodes as rope ends, as well as attaching the rope to other objects in a scene.

	<members>
		<member name="rope_length" type="int">
Length of the rope. Segments will be `rope_length / rope_particles` long.
        </member>

		<member name="start_anchor" type="NodePath">
NodePath to a node to anchor the start of the rope to. The origin of the rope will follow this node. Can point to self.
		</member>
		<member name="end_anchor" type="NodePath">
NodePath to a node to anchor the end of the rope to. The end of the rope will follow this node.
		</member>
		<member name="anchors" type="RopePositions">
A RopePositions resource containing additional anchors to attach the rope to. All anchors will be aligned to the nearest frame, and so the positions
are dependent on the number of particles in the rope and the LOD.
		</member>

		<member name="appearance" type="RopeAppearance">
A RopeAppearance resource containing properties that control how the rope is rendered.
		</member>

		<member name="simulation_rate" type="float">
Framerate to run the simulation at in FPS.
        </member>
		<member name="stiffness_iterations" type="int">
When performing stiffness calculations, the number of passes through the rope to run per frame.
Higher values will improve stiffness stability.
        </member>
		<member name="stiffness" type="float">
Stiffness factor. Controls stretchyness of rope.
Should be around [0.8 - 1.2] for a realistic rope.
Higher values may lead to instability in the simulation.
        </member>

		<member name="wind" type="Vector3">
Wind direction.
		</member>
		<member name="wind_scale" type="float">
Scale factor to apply to the wind vector when applying it to the rope simulation.
		</member>
		<member name="wind_noise" type="FastNoiseLite">

		<member name="gravity" type="Vector3">
Gravity vector to apply to the rope simulation. Default is (0, -9.8, 0).
		</member>
		<member name="damping" type="float">
Velocity damping factor to apply to the rope simulation. 0 is undamped, 100 is heavily damped.
		</member>
		</member>


		<member name="preprocess_iterations" type="int">
When the rope is first created, the number of simulations steps to run before rendering
for the first time. Simulation will be run at `preprocess_delta` time steps.
        </member>
		<member name="preprocess_delta" type="int">
Time step to run the pre-process simulation at when the rope is rebuilt. In seconds.
