	<brief_description>
		A fast verlet rope class.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The class renders "rope" using verlet integration. It supports using nodes as rope ends, as well as attaching the rope to other objects in a scene.

	<members>
        <member name="rope_particles" type="int">
The number of particles that make up the rope simulation. There will be N-1 segments in the rope.
The smallest number of particles you can have is 2.
        </member>
		<member name="rope_width" type="float">
Diameter of the rope. The rope caps will be scaled by this value as well.
        </member>
		<member name="rope_length" type="int">
Length of the rope. Segments will be `rope_length / rope_particles` long.
        </member>
		<member name="rope_sides" type="int">
Number of sides to render the rope with. Minimum is 3. If less than 3 the rope sides will be based on the rope_width.
        </member>
		<member name="rope_twist" type="float">
The rate at which the V parameter of the UV texture space repeats along the rope.
        </member>
		<member name="rope_lod" type="int">
The number of subdivisions to divide the segments by.
A catmull spline will be used to interpolate along the rope, increasing curvature.
Switch to wireframe view to see impact of this setting on polygon count.
        </member>


		<member name="simulation_rate" type="float">
Framerate to run the simulation at in FPS.
        </member>
		<member name="stiffness_iterations" type="int">
When performing stiffness calculations, the number of passes through the rope to run per frame.
Higher values will improve stiffness stability.
        </member>
		<member name="stiffness" type="float">
Stiffness factor. Controls stretchyness of rope.
Should be around [0.8 - 1.2] for a realistic rope.
Higher values may lead to instability in the simulation.
        </member>


		<member name="preprocess_iterations" type="int">
When the rope is first created, the number of simulations steps to run before rendering
for the first time. Simulation will be run at `preprocess_delta` time steps.
        </member>
		<member name="preprocess_delta" type="int">
Time step to run the pre-process simulation at when the rope is rebuilt. In seconds.
