        <brief_description>
		A resource for describing the appearance of a Rope.
	</brief_description>
        <description>
		This resource contains properties that control how a Rope is rendered. It also allows for the attachment of nodes at points along the rope.

        <members>
                <member name="rope_width" type="float">Diameter of the rope. The rope caps will be scaled by this value as well.</member>
                <member name="rope_sides" type="int">Number of sides to render the rope with. Minimum is 3. If less than 3 the rope sides will be based on the rope_width.</member>
                <member name="rope_twist" type="float">The rate at which the V parameter of the UV texture space repeats along the rope.</member>
                <member name="rope_lod" type="int">
The number of subdivisions to divide the segments by.
A catmull spline will be used to interpolate along the rope, increasing curvature.
Switch to wireframe view to see impact of this setting on polygon count.

                <member name="particles_per_meter" type="float">Number of particles per meter of rope. The smallest number of particles you can have is 2.</member>
                <member name="material" type="Material">The material to use when rendering the rope. If null, the default material will be used.</member>
